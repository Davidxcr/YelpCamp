This is a Yelp like project for Campgrounds that implements CRUD and other things which i currently have no idea of, as time goes on I'll have to update this.
To start the project:
1. Run "npm install"
2. From your integrated terminal, run "node seeds/index.js"
3. Run "node app.js" to get started.
4. Visit "localhost:3000/campgrounds" in your browser.

Thank you.
